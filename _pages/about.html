      Neuroaesthetics is an emerging discipline within cognitive neuroscience that seeks to understand the biological basis of aesthetic experiences. We aim to conduct foundational research in neuroaesthetics and apply these insights to promote human well-being.

          The aim of neuroaesthetics is to understand neural systems that underlie aesthetic experiences and choices. This includes investigating the nature and neural basis of beauty, art, design, and architecture.

          Education
        </h2>
        <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l mb4">
          Grounded in basic science, the PCfN aims to promote dialogue across disciplines and to educate — and be informed by — the arts community and general public. Serving as a multidisciplenary hub for scholars in neuroscience, psychology, business, philosophy, the arts and humanities, we will offer new educational opportunities for those interested in the empirical study of aesthetics.
