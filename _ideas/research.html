This particular style of gestural abstraction was dynamic and vigorous, and emphasised the physical act of painting in itself as essential to the finished piece. We are interested in how this “movement” in abstract art is processed by viewers, and how this affects their aesthetic appreciation of the work. Stacey Humphries, a postdoc in the lab, is currently examining whether the aesthetic appreciation of action paintings changes in Parkinson’s disease patients who may have more difficulty cognitively representing action and movement. Stacey is also using fMRI to determine which brain regions are involved when healthy adults view “dynamic” vs. “static” artworks. -->
                We explore how individuals experience the quality of movement in abstract art, and in how this affects aesthetic appreciation of the work. We also examine whether aesthetic appreciation for motion is modified in Parkinson’s disease patients, who may experience greater difficulty forming cognitive representations of actions and movement.

                There is enormous variety in the universe of visual art. A powerful method to bring order to this chaos is network analysis. Networks help us cluster images that have similar physical properties or been described using similar language. These groupings help us reveal underlying patterns in how we respond to art and what drives our appreciation for beauty.

                Abstract art paintings are highly heterogenous. Since artists often create paintings that had never been seen before and, furthermore, are not restricted by content, these paintings differ in size, form and color in every thinkable way. A relatively new method to bring order to this chaos is network analysis. With the help of networks, it is possible to cluster images with similar objective properties or objects that have been described with similar words.

                Do judgments of beauty influence moral behavior? Although it seems obvious that beauty and morality should be independent, recent studies from our lab show that people with facial anomalies, like scars or paralysis, are seen as having worse social traits, including morally-relevant characteristics like untrustworthiness.

                Jackson Pollock, a key figure in the abstract expressionist movement, famously created his paintings through action, by literally dripping and pouring paint onto the canvas. This particular style of gestural abstraction was dynamic and vigorous, and emphasised the physical act of painting in itself as essential to the finished piece. We are interested in how this “movement” in abstract art is processed by viewers, and how this affects their aesthetic appreciation of the work. Stacey Humphries, a postdoc in the lab, is currently examining whether the aesthetic appreciation of action paintings changes in Parkinson’s disease patients who may have more difficulty cognitively representing action and movement. Stacey is also using fMRI to determine which brain regions are involved when healthy adults view “dynamic” vs. “static” artworks.
