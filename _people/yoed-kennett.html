  Yoed Kenett has a Ph.D. (2015) in neuroscience from Bar-Ilan University, Israel. Currently he is a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, working at the labs of Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill and Dr. Anjan Chatterjee. His research computationally and empirically investigates the structure of semantic memory (our memory of knowledge and facts) and how it constrains cognitive processes operating over it, such as creativity, aesthetics, and memory retrieval, in typical and clinical populations. He then applies neurocognitive empirical methods to study these quantitative findings.
