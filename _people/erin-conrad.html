<p>
  I am interested in ethical decision making and finding out what factors influence our understanding of ethical questions. I completed an M.A. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics of Health at University College London, where I studied the ethics of research on large groups as well as the ethics of conscientious objection in medicine. I then completed my M.D. at University of Michigan. I am now a neurology resident at Penn.
