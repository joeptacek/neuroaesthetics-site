bio: "Born in Uruguay, Rafael Viñoly settled in New York in 1979 from where he oversees an award-winning practice with projects spanning six continents. Viñoly’s work is marked by a sustained structural originality that transcends the passing fads of architectural movements, and he is driven by the belief that the essential responsibility of architecture is to generate the most elegant and logical solution within the economy of each project. He is a member of the American Institute of Architects, the National Academy, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Japan Institute of Architects, and the Sociedad Central de Arquitectos in Argentina."
