  Stacey trained in experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Manchester, UK, where she received a B.Sc. in Psychology, a Masters in Research Methods and Statistics, and a Ph.D. in Psychology. She joined the PCfN as a postdoc in 2016. Her research focuses on how sensorimotor representations shape language and conceptual processing, and she has recently begun to apply this work in the domain of aesthetic experience. Stacey is using fMRI to determine whether movement and visual motion processing areas of the brain are involved when people view dynamic action paintings. She is also investigating how aesthetic experiences of action paintings may be altered in neurological patients with damage to the motor system.
