<p>
  I received a D.D.S. degree as well as a B.A. degree in philosophy from the University of Jena. Previously, I performed research in neuroembryology as well as empirical aesthetics, focusing on face attractiveness, beauty in visual abstract artworks, and philosophical aesthetics at the Institute of Anatomy I in Jena. At present, I am a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Pennsylvania working on global image properties and their correlation with neurophysiological activities. I am trying to relate the neuronal responses to landscape paintings, art portraits, and abstract art paintings with their statistical image properties. Special focus is on specific areas of the sensorimotor system and the emotion-valuation system.
