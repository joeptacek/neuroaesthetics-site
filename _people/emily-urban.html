  I received a BA from the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied Fine Arts and Visual Studies with a concentration in the “Science and Philosophy of Seeing.” I am interested in how visual perception can affect our comprehension of the world and of art. Besides serving as Lab Manager for the PCfN, I'm currently researching how we perceive human bodies. In my free time, I continue to build my artistic practice and freelance.
