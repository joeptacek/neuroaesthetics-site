<p>
  I am interested in the role of experience in forming individual face preferences. In ChatLab, my project focuses on how viewer age and subject age interact to affect the perception of facial attractiveness. I am a second-year doctoral student at the School of Psychology, South China Normal University. I received my master's degree from SCNU in 2018 where I investigated the relation between obesity and cognitive control, and how it can be modulated by aesthetics of food. Beyond research, I enjoy reading, jogging, and traveling.
