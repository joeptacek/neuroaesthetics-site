  Dr. Workman joined the Penn Center for Neuroaesthetics in July 2018 to study whether and how negative character judgments change the way people with disfigured faces are treated. To this end, Dr. Workmanâ€™s research integrates functional neuroimaging methods with the psychology of perception and behavioral economics.

  In order to facilitate the continued boom in neuroaesthetics research that has taken place over the past decade, Drs. Workman and Chatterjee recently created the <a class="link dim blue underline" href="https://cliffordworkman.com/resources" target="_blank">Face Image Meta-Database (fIMDb)</a> and the ChatLab Disfigured Face Database (CDFD). These are tools aimed at helping researchers to identify stimuli for neuroscience and behavioral studies on the aesthetics of faces, social decision-making, and stigma.
