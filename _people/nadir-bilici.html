<p>
  After studying neurobiology at UC Berkeley, I worked as a product manager developing health & fitness apps in Palo Alto. I am now a fourth year medical student at Perelman School of Medicine and am interested in the intersection of technology and medicine. In the ChatLab, I am researching how implicit biases are shaped by our perception of facial features. Beyond the lab and clinic, I develop mobile apps, teach culinary medicine, and get outside as much as possible to hike, camp, ski, and play frisbee.
