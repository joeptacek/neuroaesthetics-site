  Rebecca L. Pearl, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. She received her B.A. from Duke University and her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Yale University. She completed her pre-doctoral clinical internship at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School and her post-doctoral fellowship at Penn. Dr. Pearl's research investigates the mental and physical health consequences of weight bias and stigma. Her work also examines potential strategies to reduce weight stigma, such as through the use of non-stereotypical media portrayals of obesity. Dr. Pearl is currently testing the effects of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for weight bias internalization (or self-directed stigma) on psychosocial well-being, weight, and cardiometabolic health among individuals with obesity. In addition to weight stigma, Dr. Pearl also conducts research on other forms of appearance-related stigma among patients with skin diseases and those seeking reconstructive or cosmetic surgery.
