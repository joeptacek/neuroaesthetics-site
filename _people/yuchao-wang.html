  Yuchao Wang is pursuing his B.A. in cognitive science at Haverford College. He currently conducts thesis research in ChatLab on how the brain responds to literariness in stories. Before this exciting journey in neuroaesthetics, he has researched on the biophysics of peacock feathers as perceived through avian and mammalian vision, which has evolutionary implications. In his free time, he enjoys Bach on Youtube and puppies on Instagram.
