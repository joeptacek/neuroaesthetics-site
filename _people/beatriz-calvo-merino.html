  Dr Beatriz Calvo-Merino is a Cognitive Neuroscientist working at the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Unit (Psychology Department. City, University of London, UK). She trained at University College London (UK) and Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain). Her earlier research described the neural effects of sensorimotor experience on action observation using dance experts. Her current work integrates classical neuroscientific methods (i.e. fMRI, TMS, EEG) and sensorimotor expertise, with collaboration with performing artist (dancers and choreographers) to further understand the notions of embodied aesthetics and embodied cognition."
