  Amy Belfi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology, where she directs the Music Cognition and Aesthetics Lab. She received her B.A. in Psychology from St. Olaf College, her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Iowa, and completed postdoctoral training at New York University.  Her research focuses on the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying aesthetic experience, specifically focused on music. She uses a variety of techniques, including functional neuroimaging, psychophysiology, and neuropsychological studies of patient populations. Overall, her research aims to identify and characterize how music, and other artistic works, influence behavior, affect, and cognition.
