  bio: "Bill Perthes is the Bernard C. Watson Director of Adult Education at the Barnes Foundation. With a background in philosophy and art history Bill is interested in the communicative potential of works of art, how everyday experiences inform and effect art and aesthetic experiences, and the influence engaged experiences with works of art have on viewers. Bill’s work explores the visual language of art through object based empirical art analysis. His recent research has focused on how art experiences, both short and long term, can impact and inform the work of medical professionals. In addition Bill’s research focuses on Modernism, both in Europe and the United States, with a special concentration on the Abstract Expressionist painter Robert Motherwell."
