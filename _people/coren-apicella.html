  bio: "Coren Apicella is an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Human Behavior and Origins Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research investigates how biology and culture work jointly, and separately, to shape individual and social behavior, from mate choice to cooperation, to competition. In addition to more conventional laboratory studies, a significant portion of her time is devoted to fieldwork with the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. She has published studies on the attractiveness of faces, voices, bodies and body odors. Her research has been instrumental in demonstrating that many of the regularities uncovered on attractiveness judgments in Western populations also hold true in hunter-gatherers. Her work has been featured in a number of media outlets including the New York Times, NPR, BBC and CNN."
