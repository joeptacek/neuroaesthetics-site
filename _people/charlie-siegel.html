<p>
  I am a Senior at Haverford college, pursuing a B.A in Psychology along with a minor in Neuroscience. My past experiences stem from an interest in medicine and healthcare. Previously, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, I worked as a research assistant in the Neurosciences Critical Care Unit, where I explored the challenges of extubating patients with acute neurological injury who are often intubated for airway protection. My curiosity in how clinical neuroscience interfaces cognitive science has informed my work here at ChatLab, where I am studying the relationship between neuroaesthetics and cognitive enhancement as part of my Senior Thesis. More specifically, I am interested in how incidental social information can impact our moral attitudes about cognitive enhancement. After completing my undergraduate degree, I will be attending Sidney Kimmel Medical School at Jefferson University, where I will also be exploring my research interests in health policy as part of the curriculumâ€™s population health critical inquiry track.
