  I am interested in the neuroscience of memory and language broadly. At Penn, I study semantic memory and figurative language. Examining neurological patients allows me to establish the necessity of brain regions in their support of cognition. My work identifying experimental measures sensitive to the earliest cognitive changes in neurodegenerative disease aims to impact early diagnoses and the evaluation of potential treatments. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Iowa where I studied semantic richness in patients with bilateral hippocampal damage and profound amnesia. Outside of lab, I like spending time with my wife Dana, our daughter Izzy, and our dog Boogie.
