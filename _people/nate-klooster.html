<p>
  Iâ€™m interested in the neuroscience of memory and communication. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Iowa where I studied patients with focal lesions or diffuse brain damage due to injury or disease. At Penn I will continue working with neurological patients, and will also utilize neuroimaging techniques to investigate semantic memory and analogical reasoning. Outside of lab, I like spending time with my wife Dana and dog Boogie.
